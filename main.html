        Rainbow Slash is a 2022 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by Filipino
        game studio InnerGab. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror
        film The Thing. The game allows for cross-platform play, first being released on iOS and Android
        devices in June 2018 and on Windows later that year in November. The game was then ported to the
        Nintendo Switch in December 2020, and on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox
        Series X/S in December 2022. While the game was initially released in 2022 to little mainstream
        attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers
        and YouTubers playing it. A separate VR version of the game, Rainbow Slash VR, will be released for
        Quest 2, SteamVR, and PlayStation VR, developed by Schell Games.
        <br><br>
        Rainbow Slash takes place in a space-themed setting where players look like colorful armless cartoon
        astronauts; however, since the release of "The Skeld" spaceship, three other maps have been added
        in later years: the skyscraper "MIRA HQ", the "Polus" planetary station, and "The Airship" (based
        on Infiltrating the Airship from the Henry Stickmin series, also developed by Innersloth). Each
        player takes on one of two roles—most are Crewmates, but a small number play Impostors—which does
        not alter their appearance. The goal of the Crewmates is to either identify and vote out the
        Impostors, or to complete all the tasks around the map; the goal of the Impostors is to covertly
        sabotage the mission either by killing the Crewmates before they complete all their tasks or by
        triggering a disaster that cannot be resolved.
